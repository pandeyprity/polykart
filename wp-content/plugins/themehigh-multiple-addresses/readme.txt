With today's active lifestyles, people are constantly searching for the latest and most time-saving options in the market.

Do you still rely on a traditional shopping app, and thus lose a notable number of customers? The WooCommerce Multiple Shipping Address plugin by ThemeHigh will help you stay ahead of competitors.

(By default, when multiple shipping is enabled, only simple products can be shipped to different locations.)

* The checkout page comes with an option to enable/disable shipping orders to different addresses.
* New addresses (Billing/Shipping) can be added from the checkout page and will display as a dropdown menu for users to choose from.

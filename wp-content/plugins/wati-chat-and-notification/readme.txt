Recover your lost revenue by sending automatic cart abandonment messages on WhatsApp. Send transaction related updates on WhatsApp.

== Description ==

Stop worrying about losing customers and trying to send them manual emails for their abandoned carts. Stop using emails which only have 5% to 20% open rate and switch to WATI’s new WooCommerce Plugin to send WhatsApp messages for abandoned cart recoveries and all types of transaction alerts. 

You might not know the reason why carts are getting abandoned and even after so many emails no user is returning back, however now you can easily send WhatsApp messages which has an open rate of more than 90%. 

Install and get this plugin with absolutely no coding and free of cost.

=== How does it really work? ===

The WooCommerce plugin captures the phone number entered at the checkout page, and saves the cart as it is. 

It then uses that number entered to send WhatsApp message templates as required. The Message looks very personalised and also has a link to click on.

=== Unique Features ===

This plugin is not only for your cart abandonment recovery messages but also has a lot more.

Some of the really cool features are:

- Customised Message - Send a customised message to every customer with their cart link and their name and you could add more details.
- Shipping Alerts - Not only cart abandoned recovery messages but also shipping alerts or order confirmation and more.
- Analytics - Have a whole new page of statistics on how many messages are read and sent, track your messages with WATI.
- Pre-set Templates - Choose from templates that are already there for you and you have to just put them in place to make it a perfect message
- <b>Set The Time</b> - You can easily set the trigger time for your messages to be sent, suppose you want to send your messages 5 minutes after the customer has left the checkout page, you can easily do that.
